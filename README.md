## Author

[Colin Bousige](mailto:colin.bousige@cnrs.fr), Laboratoire des Multimatériaux et Interfaces, UMR 5615 CNRS-Université Lyon 1, Villeurbanne, France.

## Duration

1 day

## Objectives

- Each participant will leave with a Quarto website published on GitHub.
- Master Quarto documents for :
  - Scientific writing (with formulas, figures, tables and references) in all types of formats (pdf, docx, pptx, html)
  - Produce automatic reports
  - Create a course/exercises in pdf/doc or online (example of a site created with Quarto: [the course site](https://colinbousige.github.io/rclass/))

## Program

- Markdown and Quarto: what are they?
- Create a qmd file, work with it, then compile it into various standard formats: pdf, doc, html, etc.
- Using YAML header options to customise the output
- Using templates
- Include code (R, Python, Julia or other) to read data, process it and display graphs or tables.
- Customise the display parameters of code blocks
- Inserting an external figure, a table, a formula, internal references or references to a bibliography
- Using parameters
- Compiling into more 'elaborate' formats: pdf and web books, interactive dashboards, PowerPoint presentations, beamer and ioslides.
- Creating a static website and publishing it online on GitHub Pages

## Prerequisites

No specific scientific field is expected: what is seen in this course is suitable for all fields. Participants must bring a computer with [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) installed. If they want to include code blocks, also install R and the `knitr` package (`install.packages("knitr")`), and/or Python and the `jupyter` package (`pip install jupyter`). Knowledge of LaTeX is a plus but not a necessity.

## Type of course

Course and practical work. [The course content is online](https://colinbousige.github.io/rclass/).
